# COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Forecasting using LSTM

## Goal
Build an LSTM-based time series forecasting model to predict future COVID-19 confirmed cases based on historical case trends.

## Approach
- Loaded historical confirmed-case time series data
- Prepared sequential input windows for supervised learning
- Trained an LSTM model to learn temporal patterns
- Generated predictions and plotted predicted vs actual curves

## Key Learnings
- Preparing time series data for recurrent neural networks (LSTM)
- Understanding temporal dependency and sequence windowing
- Visualizing forecast performance and prediction curves

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Deep learning framework used in notebook (LSTM)
- Matplotlib
