# Sentiment Analysis using NLP Techniques

## Goal
Perform sentiment analysis on text reviews to classify opinions as positive or negative, using both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches.

## Datasets
This project uses publicly available review datasets (e.g., product or restaurant reviews). Dataset files are not included due to size considerations.

## Approaches
### Classical NLP
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using tokenization and vectorization techniques
- Trained traditional classifiers for sentiment prediction

### Deep Learning
- Converted text sequences into numerical representations
- Built and trained RNN / LSTM-based models for sentiment classification
- Compared performance against classical approaches

## Key Learnings
- Fundamentals of text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Differences between traditional NLP models and sequence-based neural networks
- Strengths and limitations of deep learning for text classification

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Deep learning framework used in notebook (RNN/LSTM)
