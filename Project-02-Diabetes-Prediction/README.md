# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Goal
Build a classification model to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using health-related input features, as an introduction to logistic regression and binary classification.

## Dataset
The notebook loads the dataset from an online source (via a GitHub raw URL), so no local dataset file is required.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed basic preprocessing and cleaned/validated target labels
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated performance using standard classification metrics (e.g., accuracy/confusion matrix/classification report)

## Key Learnings
- Difference between regression vs classification
- How logistic regression models probabilities for binary outcomes
- Importance of preprocessing and evaluating classification performance

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
