# Conversational Chatbot using OpenAI GPT

## Goal
Build a conversational chatbot using a large language model to generate human-like responses, introducing prompt-based NLP systems and API-driven AI workflows.

## Approach
- Integrated OpenAI GPT API for response generation
- Designed prompt and conversation flow logic
- Maintained conversational context across user interactions
- Handled API requests and responses programmatically

## API Key Management
For security reasons, API keys are not stored in this repository.  
The notebook expects the OpenAI API key to be set as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Key Learnings
- Working with LLM APIs for conversational systems
- Prompt design and conversation context handling
- Secure handling of API credentials

## Tools Used
- Python
- OpenAI API (GPT)
