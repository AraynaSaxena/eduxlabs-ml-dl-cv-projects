# Customer Churn Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest

## Goal
Build machine learning models to predict customer churn and understand which factors contribute to customers leaving a service, using tree-based classification techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-level features and a binary churn label indicating whether a customer has left the service.

## Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier as a baseline model
- Trained a Random Forest classifier to improve performance and reduce overfitting
- Compared model performance using standard classification metrics

## Key Learnings
- Understanding decision trees and how splits are formed
- Advantages of ensemble methods such as Random Forests
- Trade-offs between model interpretability and predictive performance

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
