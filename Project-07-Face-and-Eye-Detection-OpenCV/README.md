# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

## Goal
Implement classical computer vision techniques to detect human faces and eyes in images and video streams using OpenCV.

## Approach
- Used Haar Cascade classifiers for face and eye detection
- Applied detection on both static images and video frames
- Visualized bounding boxes around detected facial features
- Explored real-time video-based detection pipelines

## Key Learnings
- Understanding classical computer vision pipelines
- Working with Haar Cascades for object detection
- Applying OpenCV for real-time video analysis

## Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
