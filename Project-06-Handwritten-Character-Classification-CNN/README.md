# Handwritten Character Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Goal
Build a deep learning model to classify handwritten characters from the Devanagari script, introducing convolutional neural networks for image-based classification tasks.

## Dataset
This project uses a Devanagari handwritten character image dataset. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size considerations.

## Approach
- Loaded and preprocessed grayscale character images
- Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Evaluated classification performance on test data
- Visualized predictions and model behavior

## Key Learnings
- Applying CNN architectures to image classification problems
- Understanding convolution, pooling, and feature extraction
- Handling multi-class image datasets in deep learning workflows

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Deep learning framework used in notebook (CNN)
- Matplotlib
